**How To Talk About Personality Types (Sessions 1-3)**

# TEASER PREVIEW

## What word best describes your personality if you:

- are interest solely in your own welfare?
- constantly talk about yourself?
- dedicate your life to helping others?
- turn your mind inward?
- turn your mind outward?
- hate humanity?
- hate women?
- hate marriage?
- lead a lonely, austere existence?

# SESSION 1

Every human being is, in one way or another, unique.

Everyone’s personality is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Let us examine ten personality types (one of which might by chance be your very own) that result from the way culture, growth, family background, and environment interact with heredity.

And, of course, we begin not with the words, but with the ideas.

## IDEAS

### 1. me first

Your attitude to life is simple, direct, and aboveboard - every decision you make is based on the answer to one question: “What’s in it for me?” If your selfishness, greed, and ruthless desire for self-advancement hurt other people, that’s too bad. “This is a tough world, pal, dog eat dog and all that, and I, for one, am not going to be left behind!”

> ***An egoist***

### 2. the height of conceit

“Now, let’s see. Have you heard about all the money I’m making? Did I tell you about my latest amorous conquest? Let me give you my opinion - I know, because I’m an expert at practically everything!” You are boastful to the point of being obnoxious - you have only one string to your conversational violin, namely, your-self; and on it you play a number of monotonous variations: what you think, what you have done, how good you are, how you would solve the problems of the world, etc. ad nauseam.

> ***an egotist***

### 3. let me help you

You have discovered the secret of true happiness - concerning yourself with the welfare of others. Never mind your own interests, how’s the next fellow getting along?

> ***An altruist***

### 4. leave me alone

Like a biochemist studying a colony of bacteria under the microscope, you minutely examine your every thought, feeling, and action. Probing, futile questions like “What do other people think of me?”, “How do I look?”, and “Maybe I shouldn’t have said that?” are your constant nagging companions, for you are unable to realize that other people do not spend as much time and energy analyzing you as you think.

You may seem unsocial, yet your greatest desire is to be liked and accepted. You may be shy and quiet, you are often moody and unhappy, and you prefer solitude or at most the company of one person to a crowd. You have an aptitude for creative work and are uncomfortable engaging in activities that require cooperation with other people. You may even be a genius, or eventually turn into one.

> ***An introvert***

### 5. let’s do it together

You would be great as a teacher, counselor, administrator, insurance agent. You can always become interested-sincerely, vitally interested - in other people’s problems. You’re the life of the party, because you never worry about the effect of your actions, never inhibit yourself with doubts about or propriety. You are usually happy, generally full of high spirits; you love to be with people - lots of people. Your thoughts, your interests, your whole personality are turned outward.

> ***An extrovert***

### 6. neither extreme

You have both introverted and extroverted tendencies - at different times and on different occasions. Your interests are turned, in about equal proportions, both inward and outward. Indeed, you’re quite normal - in the sense that your personality is like that of most people.

> ***An ambivert***

### 7. people are no damn good

Cynical, embittered, suspicious, you hate everyone. (Especially, but never to be admitted, yourself?) The perfectibility of the human race? “Nonsense! No way!” The stupidity, the meanness, and the crookedness of most mortals (”Most? Probably all!”) - that is your favorite theme.

> ***A misanthrope***

### 8. women are no damn good

Sometime in your dim past, you were crossed, scorned, or deeply wounded b a woman (a mother, or mother figure, perhaps?). So now you have a carefully constructed defense against further hurt - you hate all women.

> ***A misogynist***

### 9. “marriage is an institution - and who wants to live in an institution?”

You will not make the ultimate legal commitment. Members of the opposite sex are great as lovers, roommates, apartment or house-sharers, but not as lawfully wedded spouses. The ties that bind are to binding for you. You may possibly believe, and possibly, for yourself, be right, that a commitment is deeper and more meaningful if freedom is available without judicial processdings.

> ***A misogamist***

### 10. “…that the flesh is heir to…”

Self-denial, austerity, lonely contemplation - these are the characteristics of the good life, so you claim. The simplest food and the least amount of it that will keep body and soul together, combined with abstinence from fleshly, earthly pleasures, will eventually lead to spiritual perfection - that is your philosophy.

> ***An ascetic***

## USING THE WORDS

You have been introduced to ten valuable words - but in each case, as you have noticed, you have first considered the ideas that these words represent. Now say the words - each one is respelled phonetically so that you will be sure to pronounce it correctly.

Say each word aloud. This the first important step to complete mastery. As you hear a word in your own voice, think of its meaning. Are you quite clear about it? If not, reinforce your learning by rereading the explanatory paragraph or paragraphs.

### Can you pronounce the words?

| Word | Phonetic | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| phonetic | fəˈnɛtɪk | of or relating to the sounds of speech |
| egoist | ˈiːɡɔɪst | a person who is selfishly concerned with their own interests |
| egotist | ˈiːɡətɪst | a person who is excessively self-absorbed |
| altruist | ˈɔːltʃərɪst | a person who is unselfishly concerned for or devoted to the welfare of others |
| introvert | ˈɪntrəʊvət | a person who is predominantly concerned with their own thoughts and feelings rather than with external things |
| extrovert | ˈɛkstrəʊvət | a person who is predominantly concerned with external things rather than with their own thoughts and feelings |
| ambivert | ˈæmbɪvət | a person who is equally comfortable in both extroverted and introverted social situations |
| misanthrope | ˈmɪsænθrəʊp | a person who dislikes humankind and avoids human society |
| misogynist |  |  |
| misogamist |  |  |
| ascetic |  |  |
